## Description

Memory Game is a matching of cards game. To win you have to make all cards on the board match.

The game works by the user clicking on the cards on the board, when two cards match they will be locked in
an open position and added to a list of matched cards. If the cards do not match, they will be flipped back over.
When you start the game a timer will start to count upwards counting in seconds and minutes. There is also a star rating
that will go down after a set number of moves has been reached. When the game finishes, a pop-up modal will show itself to the
player, displaying the time spent and the star rating achieved, and asking the user wants to play again.
